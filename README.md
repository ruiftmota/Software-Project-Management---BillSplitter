# Software Project Management

This project assignment was made as a requirement to the course of Project Management and as such the focus was not so much on the
complexity of what was developed, but more on the whole documentation that needed to be made and all the specifications that were 
discussed with the professor that acted as a "client".

The project followed a waterfall approach as required in the course, to better understand the importance of each document as what exactly should be present in each.

As such the software is composed by 3 main modules:
- Android application
- Server with an SQL database
- Simple connection API

The remaining documentation that accompanied the project included:
- Vision and scope
- Software Development Plan
- Quality Assurance Plan

- Software requirements specification
- Risk Plan
- Acceptance Test Plan

- Software Architecture Plan

- Acceptance Test Report
- Quality Assessment Report

- Post-Mortem Analysis
